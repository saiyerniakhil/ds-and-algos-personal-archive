* ## What is Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism ?
    *Encapsulation* is the mechanism that binds together code and data it manipulates and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. *Inheritance* is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object. *Polymorphism* is the feature that allows one interface to be used for general class actions.
  
* ## Method Overloading Vs Method Overriding
    Method overloading: When a method in a class having the same method name with different arguments is said to be method overloading. Method overriding : When a method in a class having the same method name with same arguments is said to be method overriding.(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12374399/what-is-the-difference-between-method-overloading-and-overriding)
